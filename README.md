# we-need-to-create-a-python-script-for-copying-code-from-the-url-then-modifying-pasting-in-sublime

We need to Create a Python Script that Does the Following Tasks >>

Task 1 > the script should open multiple urls from w3schools.com 

Task 2 > then the script should find the starting word and the ending word from the code in the url from w3schools.com 

For Example: to find the Starting & Ending Word, go to the url > https://www.w3schools.com/js/tryit.asp?filename=tryjs_number_tostring < you can find the starting word as DOCTYPE and ending word as html

Task 3 > then the script should copy the code w.r.t starting word and ending word 

Task 4 > then the script should open only single sublime file  

Task 5 > then the script should add three spaces between the codes that is copied

Task 6 > then the script should paste the copied code to the single sublime file and save the file,
